# Beyond the Model: Operationalizing 4,586 Bigfoot Sightings

This repository contains the [abstract](ABSTRACT.md), [slides](slides/) and [data](data/) for my talk entitled *Beyond the Model: Operationalizing 4,586 Bigfoot Sightings*. In the talk, I show how I built the [Bigfoot Classinator](https://bigfoot-classinator.github.io/). Code for that application can be found [here](https://github.com/bigfoot-classinator).
